Avoid showing same WordPress post in multiple loops. Fresh content in every loop.

== Description ==

Are you seeing the same post repeated in multiple sections in a page? For example, a post appearing under "Most Recent" AND "Latest Posts"? Try installing this plugin!

Avoid Repeating Posts intelligently avoids repeating a post on a page which has already displayed that post. It does this by keeping track of which titles have been displayed in every loop, and ensures that subsequent loops omit that post from their query.

Avoid Repeating Posts ensures that you show a wider variety of your content on the same page, helping to keep your readers interested.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Changelog ==

= 1.1.0 =
* Uses permalinks rather than title for detecting previously displayed posts (more reliable)

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release
